# VRDS Experiment 2 — notes for anyone working in this repo

A PhD study: participants answer four short blocks, then five emergency scenarios, then see their
results, then give feedback. React 19 + Chakra UI v3 + Vite + TypeScript.

## Before analyzing any collected data

**Read these two, in this order.**

1. `Generated Outputs/HOW_TO_READ_MY_DATABASE.md` — the data dictionary for the MongoDB
   `participants` collection: every field, what it means, which numbers are raw and which are
   computed, and a list of traps that produce confident but meaningless findings.
2. `Generated Outputs/HOW_TO_ANALYZE_MY_DATA.md` — which questions the data can answer, which
   analyses answer them, what may and may not be claimed, and which figures to build. Written for a
   person or an AI agent arriving with no other context.

Two of those traps matter enough to repeat here:

- **Filter on `status: "Study Completed"`.** Unfinished runs hold real but partial data and will
  quietly bias every average.
- **`headline` and `analysis` are derived from `blocks`.** Correlating a derived field with the raw
  field it came from is not a finding.

## Running it

```
npm run dev       # the study, on http://localhost:5173
npm run server    # the API that writes to local MongoDB, on port 4000
```

The study runs **without** the server — it then saves to the browser only, and nothing is queued.
The server check happens once at page load, so if you start the API afterwards, **refresh the page**
or that session stays local-only.

## Before changing anything

```
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run validate:block5 && npm run build
```

`validate:block5` must print `ALL TESTS PASS`, `ALL APA CHECKS PASS` and `ALL DATABASE GATES
PASSED`. It is the guard on the scoring model and on what reaches MongoDB; treat a failure there as
a blocker, not a warning.

The last of those three comes from `npm run validate:dbshape`, which runs the real `dbShape.ts`
builders over three simulated participants. It is the only check on `analysis` — nothing in there is
ever displayed, so a wrong number would otherwise sit unnoticed until somebody opened the collection
to write a paper.

## Two files that carry rules rather than code

- **`src/experiment/storage.ts`** — the only module allowed to talk to the server. Everything is
  written to the browser first and sent afterwards, so a stopped API never costs a participant
  their session. Do not add a second path to the server.
- **`src/experiment/dbShape.ts`** — the only place where the study's internal names are translated
  into database names. If a field name in MongoDB looks wrong, it is defined here and nowhere else.
  It also builds every `analysis.*` section, which means it runs real arithmetic; `npm run
  validate:dbshape` is what stands over that.

## Things that are deliberate, not oversights

- **Three simulations fail on purpose until the calculation pass (since 18 September 2026).** The
  researcher had the options redesigned to make sense first; `simulate_vci` (V5),
  `simulate_stability` (S3, S4) and `simulate_position` (the 3x ratio) are to be re-tuned to them
  afterwards. Every check on the options themselves passes. Do not revert an option's content or
  numbers to make one of these pass — see `docs/BLOCK5_SCENARIO_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md`, section 2g.
- **A final choice reached through APA is judged on the profile the participant brought into the
  scenario**, exactly like a choice kept after the CVR (since 18 September 2026). Neither path
  re-labels the choice inside its own scenario; both move the profile for the next one. Relabeling
  on the clarified profile would let a participant who changes value every scenario score 56 instead
  of 31. Gate V8 in `simulate_vci.cjs` guards it; ties in fit are broken by `policyDelivery`, never
  by id (V9).
- **VCI's label weights are derived, not chosen (since 19 September 2026).** Each label carries the
  average place score of the places it covers, `b(r) = (n − r) / (n − 1)`: on six options 1.00 /
  0.80 / 0.50 / 0.10, so blind picking is exactly 50. The six levels (Highly Consistent, Mostly
  Consistent, Moderate, Low, Very Low, Highly Inconsistent) sit at 90 / 80 / 65 / 50 / 30, computed
  from the same weights. Do not hand-tune either; gates V10–V12 check both. Method:
  `docs/BLOCK5_VCI_METHOD.md`; figures: `npm run report:vci`.
- The "How to read the four values in this scenario" section is absent from scenario 6 on purpose:
  its four options are the four values, and naming them would turn the prediction test into "pick
  your value".

- Participants are never shown an alignment verdict ("Misaligned with your values") or the scoring
  arithmetic. Both were removed on purpose: telling someone how they scored, or how the scoring
  works, changes how they answer the remaining scenarios. The last place the verdict survived was a
  badge under each option title in the compare-charts overlay, removed on 15 September 2026, so no
  live scenario prints one anywhere. The level is still computed and still stored — it is simply
  never shown while the participant is still choosing.
- Scenario 5 is a wish rather than a decision. It is excluded from consistency, stability and the
  reflection measures, but included in the position effect.
- The option ordering (the planner) is settled. It has been reviewed and is not to be "fixed".
- **Scenario 6 is a test of the model, not of the participant.** It runs four options rather than
  six, shows no performance numbers, runs no reflection, and must never update the profile. If it
  ever produced churn, `STABILITY_CHURN_CEILING` and every gate resting on it would be invalidated.
  `decisionRole: "predicted"` is what keeps it out; do not remove it.
- **The scenario-6 prediction is shown AFTER the choice.** Moving it earlier destroys the only
  measurement the scenario exists for, because a choice made after seeing a guess cannot be told
  from a choice suggested by it.
- **`PREDICTION_VERSION` must move whenever the prediction rule does.** It is stamped on stored
  predictions, and records made under different rules must not be pooled.
- **The insights page and the post-Block-4 final analysis page are not timed.** Removed on 15
  September 2026: they are pages a participant reads, so their duration measures reading speed and
  nothing the study asks about. The totals still include the time — only the two per-page numbers
  are gone. `UNTIMED_DISPLAY_STAGES` in `telemetry.ts` is the list, and `dbShape.ts` uses it to
  strip the two from any ledger written before the change.
- **`analysis.mpf_predictions_every_scenario` is computed after the fact for scenarios 1–5.** Only
  scenario 6's probabilities were ever on screen. Every row carries
  `was_shown_to_the_participant`, and `self_check` re-derives scenario 6 by the same route to prove
  the recomputation still matches the live one. If that check ever fails, the section is wrong.
